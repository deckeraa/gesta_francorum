Having now reached this end which the Lord Jesus daily laid out to his disciples,
especially in the Gospel saying: "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" there became therefore a strong motion through all the regions of Gaul,
such that if anyone studiously desired to follow God with a pure heart and mind, and after him wished to carry the cross faithfully, not to be slothful to more quickly take hold of the road to the Holy Sepulchre.
For the Apostle of the Roman Seat set out as soon as possible to the parts beyond the mountains with his archbishops, bishops, abbots, and presybters, and being subtly (precisely?) to talk and to preach, saying that if someone wanted to make his soul safe, not to hesitate humbly to begin the road of the Lord, and if supply of money (denarii) was lacking to him, the Divine would give to him sufficient grace.

For the Master Apostle (domnus apostolicus, i.e. the Pope) said "Brothers, you must suffer much for the name of Christ, namely miseries, poverty, nudity, persecutions, want, infirmaties, hunger, thirst, and others of this type, just as Christ said to his disciples: "You must suffer much for my name" and "Do not be ashamed to speak before the faces of men; I truly will give you speech (literally, 'mouth') and eloquence." and thereafter "A large reward will follow for you".
And having then begun to spread this message gradually through the whole region and the fatherlands of Gaul, the Franks, hearing such things, immediately joined the cross to their right shoulder, saying to themselves to follow the footsprints of Christ unanimously, by which they were redeemed from the hand of Tartarus (hell). At this very moment they were far from their houses in Gaul.
